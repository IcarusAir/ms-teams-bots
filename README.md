MS Teams bot that tallies reactions as points and displays the score at the end of the lecture

My school does online learning and lectures through MS Teams. In the chat everyone is making funny comments and trying to get people to react to them. If only there was a bot that could tally the reactions as points after the lecture...

This is my first time making a bot and using JavaScript, this Respository is for tracking my progress.
